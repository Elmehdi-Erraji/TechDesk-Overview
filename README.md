# TechDesk Project

Welcome to the TechDesk project! This repository contains a fully functional ticketing system built to streamline support operations. The project consists of two main components: a robust backend service running inside a Docker container and a Java Swing desktop client provided as a JAR file. In addition, comprehensive API documentation, code documentation, and testing have been completed.

## Overview

The TechDesk project was developed to efficiently manage support tickets and related operations. Below are the key aspects of the work:

### Backend Service

- **Functionality:**  
  Handles RESTful API calls for managing users, tickets, comments, and audit logs.
- **Database Integration:**  
  Interacts with an Oracle database that stores critical tables such as `APP_USERS`, `TICKETS`, `COMMENTS`, and `TICKET_AUDIT_LOGS`.
- **Technology:**  
  Packaged as a Docker container for ease of deployment.

### Database Design

- **Schema Details:**  
  - Uses `RAW(16)` fields to store UUIDs, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness.
  - Enforces relationships through primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.
- **Security:**  
  Implements role-based access control to differentiate access levels among administrators, support staff, and employees.

### Java Swing Client

- **User Interface:**  
  Provides an intuitive graphical interface for interacting with the backend services.
- **Delivery:**  
  Delivered as a JAR file for easy execution on any system with Java installed.

### Documentation and Testing

- **API Documentation:**  
  Full Swagger API documentation is available to detail the available endpoints.  
  Access it here: [Swagger API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
- **Code Documentation:**  
  Comprehensive Javadoc has been generated.  
  View it at: [Code Documentation](http://localhost:63342/TechDesk/target/reports/apidocs/com/techdesk/services/Impl/package-summary.html)  
  *Note:* The port (`63342`) is provided by IntelliJ.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the TechDesk project in your environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:**  
  Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

- **Java:**  
  Make sure Java JDK 8 or higher is installed. Download it from [Oracle's Java downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Deploying with Docker Compose

This project provides a turnkey Docker setup to deploy both the backend service and the Oracle XE database together. The following instructions guide you through building and running the Docker containers.

#### Dockerfile (Backend)

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your project (if not already present):

```dockerfile
# Use an OpenJDK 17 slim image (adjust if necessary)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Spring Boot JAR into the container (ensure your JAR is built and located in the target folder)
COPY target/techdesk-backend.jar app.jar

# Expose the application port (matches server.port in application.properties)
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

> **Note:** Build your backend JAR (e.g., using Maven or Gradle) so that it is available at `target/techdesk-backend.jar`.

#### docker-compose.yml

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in the project root with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  oracle-xe:
    image: container-registry.oracle.com/database/express:21.3.0-xe
    container_name: oracle-xe
    environment:
      - ORACLE_PWD=oracle
      - ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=AL32UTF8
    ports:
      - "1521:1521"
      - "5500:5500"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "echo 'SELECT 1 FROM DUAL;' | sqlplus system/oracle@localhost:1521/XEPDB1 || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 10
    volumes:
      # Mount the SQL script for database initialization from src/main/resources/db/script.sql
      - ./src/main/resources/db/script.sql:/app/script.sql

  techdesk-backend:
    build: .
    container_name: techdesk-backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      oracle-xe:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      # These values override the properties in your application.yml
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-xe:1521/XEPDB1
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=techdesk
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=techdesk_password
```

#### How to Start the Services

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elmehdi-Erraji/TechDesk.git
   cd TechDesk
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Containers:**

   Run the following command to build the backend image and start both the Oracle XE database and the backend service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Verify the Containers are Running:**

   Use the command below to check that both containers are up and running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **(Optional) Initialize the Database:**

   If your backend does not automatically initialize the database schema (via `ddl-auto=update` or a migration tool), you can manually run the SQL script:

    - Enter the Oracle container:
      ```bash
      docker exec -it oracle-xe bash
      ```
    - Launch SQL*Plus:
      ```bash
      sqlplus system/oracle@XEPDB1
      ```
    - Run the script:
      ```sql
      @/app/script.sql
      ```
    - Exit SQL*Plus and the container:
      ```sql
      EXIT
      ```
      ```bash
      exit
      ```

5. **Access the Backend:**

   The backend service should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

---

### Running the Java Swing Client

1. **Obtain the Swing Client JAR:**

   Ensure that the provided Swing client JAR (e.g., `techdesk-swing.jar`) is in your working directory.

2. **Launch the Swing Client:**

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   java -jar techdesk-swing.jar
   ```

   This launches the Swing client, which will connect to the backend service at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Ensure that the Docker containers are running before starting the client.

### Viewing the Code Documentation

If you need to review the generated code documentation:

1. **Open Your Browser:**

   Navigate to the Javadoc index. For example, if you're using IntelliJ, you can access it at:

   [http://localhost:63342/TechDesk/target/reports/apidocs/com/techdesk/services/Impl/package-summary.html](http://localhost:63342/TechDesk/target/reports/apidocs/com/techdesk/services/Impl/package-summary.html)

   *Note:* The port (`63342`) is provided by IntelliJ.

## Additional Information

### Using the SQL Script

The file `script.sql` contains the necessary statements to:

- Create the required tables (`APP_USERS`, `TICKETS`, `COMMENTS`, `TICKET_AUDIT_LOGS`, etc.).
- Insert sample data for testing, including default user accounts.

To execute this script manually:

1. Make sure you have mounted the script in the `docker-compose.yml` (if desired) or have it accessible in your container.
2. Connect to the Oracle XE container and run the script as shown in the [How to Start the Services](#how-to-start-the-services) section.

### Default Users and Credentials

Below are the default user accounts created by `script.sql` (if included in the script):

| Role     | Username   | Password      |
|----------|----------- |---------------|
| Admin    | `admin`    | `Password123` |
| Support  | `support`  | `Password123` |
| Employee | `employee` | `Password123` |

- **Admin** can view and  track changes in the audit log.
- **Support** can view and update tickets (comment, change status).
- **Employee** can create and edit their own tickets (subject to status restrictions) but cannot view system-wide data.

Feel free to modify these credentials in the `script.sql` to suit your security requirements.
